As you can see from the steps above, for DNS challenge to succeed, your web server , or reverse proxy in this case, **does not necessarily** need to be accessible over the internet. It is the DNS server that needs to be on the public internet. The DNS zone file does not necessarily need to have any host entries in it as well. There could be just one wild-card entry, which **may** point to your Traefik Load Balancer's IP address. Even if it points elsewhere, LetsEncrypt does not have a problem with it, as it just checks the (temporary) TXT record, just to ensure that you own/have-legitimate-access-to this domain `demo.wbitt.com`. This means, that it is possible to have a kubernetes cluster running in a test or production environment, on a private network , not accessible directly from outside, and still be able to get **valid** SSL certificates for your services running inside this private cluster. There are many possible scenarios, when using DNS challenge.
